  					<h2>What is Kinisiforo?</h2>
            <p>
              Kinisiforo is a new device for movement therapy and rehabilitation for neurological conditions. This device was invented and patented by a kinesiology and rehabilitation specialist to help neurological patients in Cyprus. It was successfully used for rehabilitation in patients with stroke, cerebral palsy and brain/spine injuries

            <h2>Major advantages of Kinisiforo</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>Simultaneously exercise arms, legs and torso muscles</li>
              <li>Operator can elect and adjust precisely weight bearing and force acting on lower extremities during the exercise</li>
              <li>Elliptical motion can be adjusted independently for one and another leg according to patient characteristics</li>
              <li>Zero vibration</li>
              <li>Operator can choose from passive mode, active mode and combined passive-active mode. Passive mode can be changed to active mode and vice versa quickly by decision of the patient</li>
              <li>The machine follows the patients motion and helps only where it is necessary, and not the patient follows passively the machine motion like in other devices</li>
              <li>Operator can adjust precisely intensity and speed of the exercise</li>
              <li>It is the only machine that can produce symmetrical balance and elliptical motion during one pedal stride without any acceleration</li>
              <li>Patient doesn't require extra assistance from therapist or others during exercise, but the therapist has an easy access for assistance or evaluation during the exercise where it is needed</li>

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
              <p>
                Kinisiforo helps patients to improve their neurologic conditions with a movement therapy. This approach proves to be successful for a wide range of neurological conditions, including craniocerebral injuries. It helps with improvement in neurological deficit, reducing movement disorders and finally with ultimate improvement in quality of life for usually severely disabled patients. The theoretical ground for such an effect lies in neuroplasticity, a phenomenon of stimulation innate brain capacity to change and adapt according to the environmental factors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kinisiforo works through the symmetric elliptical exercise. During the cycle, both upper and lover extremeties work simultaneously, as well as torso muscles. Such exercise can be active, passive or active/passive. Special harness allows weight adjustment and control by a counterweight mechanism on patient lower limbs during the exercise. Pedal movement and range can be independently   adjusted according to patient characteristics. During the physical exercise, patient is involved into virtual reality with a special movie that repeats patient movements and creates an imagine of walking in the natural environment.

            <h2>Why Kinisiforo is different?</h2>
            <p>
              Current approach to movement therapy: make the exercise close to natural human position in natural speed with controlled weight bearing on the lower limbs. A lot of exercise devices are based on the concept of gait training. But such approach has one major limitation: by teaching proper gait movement in a proper speed by controlling weight bearing on the legs we limit the exercise, thus patient has limited improvements.
