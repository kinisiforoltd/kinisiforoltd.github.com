  					<h2>Kinisiforo System for Elliptical Training</h2> 
            <h2>NEW METHOD FOR REHABILITATION</h2>
            <p>
              K-set is a new approach for rehabilitation in craniocerebral and spinal cord injuries, and neurological conditions, including stroke and cerebral palsy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why is it different?
            </p>
            <p>
              Current approach to movement therapy: To perform the exercise close to natural human position in natural speed with controlled weight bearing on the lower limbs. A lot of devices and rehabilitation methods are based on the concept of <i>gait training</i> with correct walking motion. But such approach has one major limitation: By teaching proper gait movement in a proper speed with the controlled weight bearing on the legs, we limit the exercise, and patient has only <i>limited improvement</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The higher the speed, the more signals go from periphery to the brain. But with every step when the patient hit the ground or the treadmill, results in <i>vibration</i>. This vibration (shock absorption) can activate proprioception, and signals go from periphery to the part of the brain, that is already damaged. If we avoid this shock absorption from legs, we could teach a <i>new part of the brain</i> (new neurons) a certain motion. According to the neuroplasticity conception, human brain has the ability to develop new neurons for a certain motion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Current exercise devices control every movement of the patient. Here patient follows the motion of the device, and not the device follows the motion of a patient. As a result we have limited strengthening and tension of the muscle. Again based on neuroplasticity, in order to stimulate the development of new neurons, the exercise intensiveness should be close to patientâ€™s limits. Thus with K-set method we make the exercise highly intensive.
            </p>
            <p>
              All devices allow precise selection of the weight load on the legs. But when a patient makes a step, one leg remains in the air, and at this certain moment, the entire weight load goes to the other leg. For this reason, through the cycle weight load is not evenly distributed to the legs, and the exercise has a suboptimal effect. At the moment most of the therapeutic walking techniques suggest to unload patient walking. In K-SET method we do exactly the opposite: instead of unloaded walking, we overload the patient legs.
            </p>
            <p>
              About the joint intensity: If we exercise certain joints with continuous aerobic exercise, close to the resting position and add eccentric resistance exercise to the agonist muscle simultaneously with concentric resistance exercise to antagonist muscle, we could create the opportunity to the muscles around the joint to exercise in a very high load-tension with minimum effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              About joint angle: First, we define what is the natural joint angle at walking, and we call this angle A. Then we define what is the pathological joint angle according to K-SET method, and we call this angle B. The proper joint angle for exercise in K-SET could be calculated by a simple formula A + B.
            </p>
